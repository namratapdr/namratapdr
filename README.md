<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in various technologies. My primary focus is on JavaScript and TypeScript, utilizing frameworks like React, Angular, and Three.js to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

On the front-end side, I thrive in crafting engaging user interfaces using modern libraries and tools. I have extensive experience with React, which allows me to create reusable components, manage state efficiently, and ensure a seamless user experience. Additionally, I'm well-versed in Angular, enabling me to build robust and scalable applications using its powerful features.

To enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of my projects, I also leverage Three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics on the web. This allows me to incorporate stunning visual effects and immersive experiences into my applications.

On the back-end, I'm proficient in working with Firebase, a cloud-based platform, to develop serverless applications and manage databases. I also have experience with PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database, and Spring Boot, a Java framework, for building robust and scalable server-side applications.

Beyond coding, I find solace in the pages of books and enjoy exploring new worlds and ideas. I'm also an avid gamer, finding joy in immersive gaming experiences that challenge and entertain.

If you're looking for a dedicated full-stack developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular, Three.js, Firebase, PostgreSQL, and Spring Boot, I'm here to collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to explore my repositories and don't hesitate to reach out to discuss potential opportunities or collaborations.
